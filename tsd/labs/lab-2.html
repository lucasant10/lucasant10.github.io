<h1>Lab 2: Primary/Backup Key/value service</h1><h2>Due: 10/15 11:59pm</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In the MapReduce lab handling failures was relatively easy because the workers
did not maintain state.  The master did maintain state, but you didn't have to
make it fault-tolerant.  Lab 2 is a first step towards fault
tolerance for servers with state.

<h3>Road map for Lab-2 to Lab-5</h3>

<p>In the next 4 labs you will build several key/value services. The services
support three RPCs: Put(key, value), Append(key, arg), and Get(key). The
service maintains a simple database of key/value pairs. Put() replaces the value
for a particular key in the database. Append(key, arg) appends arg to
key's value. Get() fetches the current value for a key.

<p>The labs differ in the degree of fault tolerance and performance they
provide for the key/value service:

<ul>

  <li>Lab 2 uses primary/backup replication,
  assisted by a view service that decides which machines are alive.  The view
  service allows the primary/backup service to work correctly in the presence
  of network partitions.  The view service itself is not replicated, and is a
  single point of failure.

  <li>Lab 3 uses the Paxos protocol to replicate the key/value database with no
  single point of failure, and handles network partitions correctly.  This
  key/value service is slower than a non-replicated key/value server would be,
  but is fault tolerant.

  <li>Lab 4 is a sharded key/value database, where each shard replicates its
  state using Paxos.  This key/value service can perform Put/Get operations in
  parallel on different shards, allowing it to support applications such as
  MapReduce that can put a high load on a storage system.  Lab 4
  also has a replicated configuration service, which tells the shards for what
  key range they are responsible. It can change the assignment of keys to
  shards, for example, in response to changing load.  Lab 4 has the core of a
  real-world design for 1000s of servers.

  <li>Lab 5 will add persistence to Lab 4, so that a key/value server
  can recover from a crash and re-join its replica group.

</ul>

<p>In each lab you will have to do substantial design.  We give you a
 sketch of the overall design (and code for the boring pieces), but you will
 have to flesh it out and nail down a complete protocol.  The tests
 explore your protocol's handling of failure scenarios as well as
 general correctness and basic performance.
 You may need to re-design (and thus re-implement) in light of problems
 exposed by the tests; careful thought and planning may help you avoid
 too many re-design cycles. We
 don't give you a description of the test cases (other than the Go code); in the
 real world, you would have to come up with them yourself.

<h3>Overview of lab 2</h3>

<p> In this lab you'll make a key/value service fault-tolerant using a form of
primary/backup replication.  In order to ensure that all parties (clients and
servers) agree on which server is the primary, and which is the backup, we'll
introduce a kind of master server, called the viewservice. The viewservice
monitors whether each available server is alive or dead. If the current primary
or backup becomes dead, the viewservice selects a server to replace it. A client
checks with the viewservice to find the current primary. The servers cooperate
with the viewservice to ensure that at most one primary is active at a time.

<p>
Your key/value service will allow replacement of failed servers. If
the primary fails, the viewservice will promote the backup to be
primary. If the backup fails, or is promoted, and there is an idle
server available, the viewservice will cause it to be the backup.
The primary will send its complete database to the new backup,
and then send subsequent Puts to the backup to ensure that the
backup's key/value database remains identical to the primary's.

<p>
It turns out the primary must send Gets as well as Puts to the backup
(if there is one), and must wait for the backup to reply before
responding to the client. This helps prevent two servers from acting
as primary (a "split brain"). Here's an example of the "split brain" trouble if 
the primary is to handle Gets by itself without talking to the backup:
S1 is the primary and S2 is the backup. The view service decides incorrectly
that S1 is dead (e.g. when the view service and S2 cannot talk to S1 because of
a network partition). The view service promotes S2 to be primary.  In its new
role, S2 has handled several Put operations without S1's knowledge (since S1 is
presumed dead).  However, there may be some client who thinks S1 is still the
primary and sends it a Get operation. If S1 replies without talking to S2, it
would have given wrong answers!

<p>
A failed key/value server may restart, but it will do so without a
copy of the replicated data (i.e. the keys and values). That is, your
key/value server will keep the data in memory, not on disk. One
consequence of keeping data only in memory
is that if there's no backup, and the primary
fails, and then restarts, it cannot then act as primary.

<p>
Only RPC may be used for interaction between clients and servers,
between different servers, and between different clients. For example,
different instances of your server are not allowed to share Go
variables or files.

<p>
The design outlined here
has some fault-tolerance and performance limitations
which make it too weak for real-world use:
<ul>
  <li>The
view service is vulnerable to failures, since it's not replicated.

  <li> The
primary and backup must process operations one at a time, limiting
their performance.

  <li>A recovering server must copy a complete database
of key/value pairs from the primary, which will be slow, even if the
recovering server has an almost-up-to-date copy of the data already
(e.g. only missed a few minutes of updates while its network
connection was temporarily broken).

  <li>The servers don't store the
key/value database on disk, so they can't survive simultaneous
crashes (e.g., a site-wide power failure).

  <li>If a temporary problem prevents primary to backup
communication, the system has only two remedies: change the view to
eliminate the backup, or keep trying; neither performs well if such
problems are frequent.

  <li>If a primary fails before acknowledging the view in which it is primary,
the view service cannot make progress---it will spin forever and not perform a
view change.

</ul>

<p>We will address these limitations in later labs by using better designs and
protocols.  This lab will help you understand the problems that you'll solve in
the succeeding labs.

<p> The primary/backup scheme in this lab is not based on any published
protocol. In fact, this lab doesn't specify a complete protocol; you must 
work out the details.  The protocol has similarities with Flat Datacenter Storage
(the viewservice is like FDS's metadata server, and the primary/backup servers
are like FDS's tractservers), though FDS pays far more attention to performance.
It's also a bit like a MongoDB replica set (though MongoDB selects the leader
with a Paxos-like election).  For a detailed description of a (different)
primary-backup-like protocol, see <a
 href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/osdi04.pdf">Chain
Replication</a>.  Chain Replication has higher performance than this lab's
design, though it assumes that the view service never declares a server dead
when it is merely partitioned.  

<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>

You must write all the code you hand in, except for code
that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to
look at anyone else's solution, and you are not allowed to look at
code from previous years. You may discuss the assignments with other
students, but you may not look at or copy each others' code. Please do
not publish your code or make it available to future students --
for example, please do not make your code visible on github.

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>
Do a <tt>git pull</tt> to get the latest lab software. We supply you
with Lab 2 skeleton code and tests in <tt>src/viewservice</tt> and
<tt>src/pbservice</tt>.

<pre>
$ add golabs
$ cd ~/golabs
$ git pull
...
$ cd src/viewservice
$ go test
2015/08/22 21:44:44 method GetRPCCount has wrong number of ins: 1
2015/08/22 21:44:44 method Kill has wrong number of ins: 1
Test: First primary ...
--- FAIL: Test1 (1.07s)
	test_test.go:13: wanted primary /var/tmp/824-1000/viewserver-9441-1, got

FAIL	viewservice	1.079s
$
</pre>

Ignore the <tt>method Kill</tt> error message now and in the future.
The tests fail because <tt>viewservice/server.go</tt> has empty
RPC handlers.

<p>
You can run your code as stand-alone programs using the source in
<tt>main/viewd.go</tt>,
<tt>main/pbd.go</tt>, and
<tt>main/pbc.go</tt>.
See the comments in <tt>pbc.go</tt>.

<h3>Part A: The Viewservice</h3>

<p> First you'll implement a viewservice and make sure it passes our tests; in
Part B you'll build the key/value service.  Your viewservice won't itself be
replicated, so it will be relatively straightforward. Part B is <i>much</i> harder than
part A, because the K/V service is replicated and you have to design much of the
replication protocol.

<p>
The view service goes through a sequence of numbered
<i>views</i>, each with a primary and (if possible) a backup.
A view consists of a view number and the identity (network port name) of
the view's primary and backup servers.

<p>
The primary in a view must always be either the primary
or the backup of the previous view. This helps ensure
that the key/value service's state is preserved.
An exception: when the viewservice first starts, it should
accept any server at all as the first primary.
The backup in a view can be any server (other than the primary),
or can be altogether missing if no server is available
(represented by an empty string, <tt>""</tt>).

<p>
Each key/value server should send a Ping RPC once per 
<tt>PingInterval</tt>
(see <tt>viewservice/common.go</tt>).
The view service replies to the Ping with a description of the current
view. A Ping lets the view service know that the key/value
server is alive; informs the key/value server of the current
view; and informs the view service of the most recent view
that the key/value server knows about.
If the viewservice doesn't receive a Ping from a server
for <tt>DeadPings</tt> <tt>PingInterval</tt>s, the
viewservice should consider the server to be dead.
When a server re-starts after a crash, it should send
one or more Pings with an argument of zero to inform
the view service that it crashed.

<p>
The view service proceeds to a new view if it hasn't
received recent Pings from both primary and backup, or
if the primary or backup crashed and restarted, or
if there is no backup and there is an idle server
(a server that's been Pinging but is
neither the primary nor the backup).
But the view service must <b>not</b> change views (i.e., return
a different view to callers) until 
the primary from the current view acknowledges
that it is operating in the current view (by sending
a Ping with the current view number). If the view service has not yet
received an acknowledgment for the current view from the primary of
the current view, the view service should not change views even if it
thinks that the primary or backup has died.
That is, the view service may not proceed from view X to view X+1
if it has not received a Ping(X) from the primary of view X.

<p> The acknowledgment rule prevents the view service from getting more than one
view ahead of the key/value servers. If the view service could get arbitrarily
far ahead, then it would need a more complex design in which it kept a history
of views, allowed key/value servers to ask about old views, and
garbage-collected information about old views when appropriate.  The downside of
the acknowledgement rule is that if the primary fails before it acknowledges the
view in which it is primary, then the view service cannot ever change views
again.

<p>
An example sequence of view changes:

<p>
<img src="lab-2a-vs.png">
</p>

The above example is overspecified; for example, when the view server
gets <tt>Ping(1)</tt> from S1 for the first time, it is also OK for it
to return view 1, as long as it eventually switches to view 2 (which
includes S2).

<p>
We provide you with a complete <tt>client.go</tt> and
appropriate RPC definitions in <tt>common.go</tt>.
Your job is to supply the needed code in <tt>server.go</tt>.
When you're done, you should pass all the <tt>viewservice</tt>
tests:

<pre>
$ cd ~/golabs/src/viewservice
$ go test
Test: First primary ...
  ... Passed
Test: First backup ...
  ... Passed
Test: Backup takes over if primary fails ...
  ... Passed
Test: Restarted server becomes backup ...
  ... Passed
Test: Idle third server becomes backup if primary fails ...
  ... Passed
Test: Restarted primary treated as dead ...
  ... Passed
Test: Viewserver waits for primary to ack view ...
  ... Passed
Test: Uninitialized server can't become primary ...
  ... Passed
PASS
ok      viewservice     7.457s
$
</pre>

<p>
The above output omits some benign Go rpc errors.

<p>
Hint: you'll want to add field(s) to <tt>ViewServer</tt> in
<tt>server.go</tt> in order to keep track of the most recent
time at which the viewservice has heard a Ping from each
server. Perhaps a <tt>map</tt> from server names to
<tt>time.Time</tt>. You can find the current time with <tt>time.Now()</tt>.

<p>
Hint: add field(s) to <tt>ViewServer</tt> to keep track of the
current view.

<p>
Hint: you'll need to keep track of whether the primary for the
current view has acknowledged it (in PingArgs.Viewnum).

<p>
Hint: your viewservice needs to make periodic decisions, for
example to promote the backup if the viewservice has missed <tt>DeadPings</tt>
pings from the primary. Add this code to the <tt>tick()</tt>
function, which is called once per <tt>PingInterval</tt>.

<p>
Hint: there may be more than two servers sending Pings. The
extra ones (beyond primary and backup) are volunteering
to be backup if needed.

<p>
Hint: the viewservice needs a way to detect that a primary
or backup has failed and re-started. For example, the primary
may crash and quickly restart without missing sending a
single Ping.

<p> Hint: study the test cases before you start programming.  If you fail a
test, you may have to look at the test code in <tt>test_test.go</tt> to figure
out the failure scenario is.

<p>
The easiest way to track down bugs is to insert log.Printf()
statements, collect the output in a file with <tt>go test &gt;
out</tt>, and then think about whether the output matches your
understanding of how your code should behave.

<p>
Remember that the Go RPC server framework starts a new thread for each
received RPC request. Thus if multiple RPCs arrive at the same time
(from multiple clients), there may be multiple threads running
concurrently in the server.

<p>The tests kill a server by setting its <tt>dead</tt> flag.  You must
make sure that your server terminates when that flag is set
(test it with <tt>isdead()</tt>), otherwise
you may fail to complete the test cases.

<h3>Part B: The primary/backup key/value service</h3>

<p>
The primary/backup key/value server source is in <tt>pbservice</tt>.
We supply you with part of a client interface
in <tt>pbservice/client.go</tt>, and part of the server
in <tt>pbservice/server.go</tt>. Clients use the service by creating a
Clerk object (see <tt>client.go</tt>) and calling its methods, which send
RPCs to the service.

<p>
Your key/value service should continue operating correctly as long as
there has never been a time at which no server was alive. It should
also operate correctly with partitions: a server that suffers
temporary network failure without crashing, or can talk to some
computers but not others. If your service is operating with just one
server, it should be able to incorporate a recovered or idle server
(as backup), so that it can then tolerate another server failure.

<p> Correct operation means that calls to Clerk.Get(k) return the latest value
set by a successful call to Clerk.Put(k,v) or Clerk.Append(k,v), or an empty
string if the key has never seen either.  All operations should provide at-most-once
semantics (see lectures 2 and 3).

<p>
You should assume that the viewservice never halts or crashes. 

<p>
Your clients and servers may only communicate using RPC, and both
clients and servers must
send RPCs with the <tt>call()</tt> function in <tt>client.go</tt>.

<p>
It's crucial that only one primary be active at any given time. You
should have a clear story worked out for why that's the case for your
design. A danger: suppose in some view S1 is the primary; the viewservice changes
views so that S2 is the primary; but S1 hasn't yet heard about the new
view and thinks it is still primary. Then some clients might talk to
S1, and others talk to S2, and not see each others' Put()s.

<p>
A server that isn't the active primary should either
not respond to clients, or respond with an error:
it should set GetReply.Err or
PutReply.Err to something other than OK.

<p> Clerk.Get(), Clerk.Put(), and Clerk.Append() should only return when they
have completed the operation. That is, Put()/Append()
should keep trying until they have
updated the key/value database, and Clerk.Get() should keep trying until it has
retrieved the current value for the key (if any). Your server must filter out
the duplicate RPCs that these client re-tries will generate to ensure
at-most-once semantics for operations.  You can assume that each clerk has only
one outstanding Put or Get.  Think carefully about what the commit point is for
a Put.

<p>
A server should not talk to the viewservice for every Put/Get
it receives, since that would put the viewservice on the critical path
for performance and fault-tolerance. Instead servers should
Ping the viewservice periodically
(in <tt>pbservice/server.go</tt>'s <tt>tick()</tt>)
to learn about new views. Similarly, the client Clerk should not
talk to the viewservice for every RPC it sends; instead, the
Clerk should cache the current primary, and only talk to the
viewservice when the current primary seems to be dead.

<p>
Part of your one-primary-at-a-time strategy should rely on the
viewservice only promoting the backup from view <i>i</i>
to be primary in view <i>i+1</i>.  If the old primary from
view <i>i</i> tries to handle a client request, it will
forward it to its backup. If that backup hasn't heard about
view <i>i+1</i>, then it's not acting as primary yet, so
no harm done. If the backup has heard about view <i>i+1</i>
and is acting as primary, it knows enough to reject the old
primary's forwarded client requests.

<p>
You'll need to ensure that the backup sees every update to the
key/value database, by a combination of the primary initializing it with
the complete key/value database and forwarding subsequent
client operations.
Your primary should forward just the arguments to each <tt>Append()</tt>
to the backup; do not forward the resulting value, which might be large.

<p>
The skeleton code for the key/value servers is in <tt>src/pbservice</tt>.
It uses your viewservice, so you'll have to set up
your <tt>GOPATH</tt> as follows:

<pre>
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/golabs
$ cd ~/golabs/src/pbservice
$ go test -i
$ go test
Single primary, no backup: --- FAIL: TestBasicFail (2.00 seconds)
        test_test.go:50: first primary never formed view
--- FAIL: TestFailPut (5.55 seconds)
        test_test.go:165: wrong primary or backup
Concurrent Put()s to the same key: --- FAIL: TestConcurrentSame (8.51 seconds)
...
Partition an old primary: --- FAIL: TestPartition (3.52 seconds)
        test_test.go:354: wrong primary or backup
...
$
</pre>

<p>
Here's a recommended plan of attack:

<ol>
<li>
You should start by modifying <tt>pbservice/server.go</tt>
to ping the viewservice to find the current view. Do this
in the <tt>tick()</tt> function. Once a server knows the
current view, it knows if it is the primary, the backup,
or neither.

<li>
Implement Get, Put, and Append handlers in <tt>pbservice/server.go</tt>; store
keys and values in a <tt>map[string]string</tt>.
If a key does not exist, Append should use an empty string
for the previous value. Implement the <tt>client.go</tt> RPC stubs.

<li>
Modify your handlers so that the primary forwards updates
to the backup.

<li>
When a server becomes the backup in a new view, the primary
should send it the primary's complete key/value database.

<li> Modify <tt>client.go</tt> so that clients keep re-trying until they get an
answer.  Make sure that you include enough information in <tt>PutAppendArgs</tt>, and
<tt>GetArgs</tt> (see <tt>common.go</tt>) so that the key/value service can
detect duplicates.  Modify the key/value service to handle duplicates correctly.

<li> Modify <tt>client.go</tt> to cope with a failed primary.
If the current primary doesn't respond, or doesn't think it's the
primary, have the client consult the viewservice (in case the primary has
changed) and try again.  Sleep for viewservice.PingInterval between re-tries to
avoid burning up too much CPU time.

</ol>

<p>
You're done if you can pass all the <tt>pbservice</tt> tests:
<pre>
$ cd ~/golabs/src/pbservice
$ go test
Test: Single primary, no backup ...
  ... Passed
Test: Add a backup ...
  ... Passed
Test: Primary failure ...
  ... Passed
Test: Kill last server, new one should not be active ...
  ... Passed
Test: at-most-once Put; unreliable ...
  ... Passed
Test: Put() immediately after backup failure ...
  ... Passed
Test: Put() immediately after primary failure ...
  ... Passed
Test: Concurrent Put()s to the same key ...
  ... Passed
Test: Concurrent Put()s to the same key; unreliable ...
  ... Passed
Test: Repeated failures/restarts ...
  ... Put/Gets done ... 
  ... Passed
Test: Repeated failures/restarts; unreliable ...
  ... Put/Gets done ... 
  ... Passed
Test: Old primary does not serve Gets ...
  ... Passed
Test: Partitioned old primary does not complete Gets ...
  ... Passed
PASS
ok      pbservice       113.352s
$
</pre>

<p>
You'll see some "method Kill has wrong number of ins" complaints
and lots of "rpc: client protocol error" and "rpc: writing response"
complaints; ignore them.

<p>
Hint: you'll probably need to create new RPCs to forward client
requests from primary to backup, since the backup should reject
a direct client request but should accept a forwarded request.

<p>
Hint: you'll probably need to create new RPCs to handle the transfer
of the complete key/value database from the primary to a new backup.
You can send the whole database in one RPC (for example,
include a <tt>map[string]string</tt> in the RPC arguments).

<p>
Hint: the state to filter duplicates must be replicated along with the key/value
state.

<p>
Hint: the tester arranges for RPC replies to be lost in tests whose
description includes "unreliable". This will cause RPCs to be executed
by the receiver, but since the sender sees no reply, it cannot
tell whether the server executed the RPC.

<p>
Hint: you may need to generate numbers that have
a high probability of being unique. Try this:
<pre>
import "crypto/rand"
import "math/big"
func nrand() int64 {
  max := big.NewInt(int64(1) << 62)
  bigx, _ := rand.Int(rand.Reader, max)
  x := bigx.Int64()
  return x
}
</pre>

<p>Hint: the tests kill a server by setting its <tt>dead</tt> flag.  You must
make sure that your server terminates correctly when that flag is set, otherwise
you may fail to complete the test cases.

<p>
Hint: even if your viewserver passed all the tests in Part A, it
may still have bugs that cause failures in Part B.

<p>
Hint: study the test cases before you start programming
