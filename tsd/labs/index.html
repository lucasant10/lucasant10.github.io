  <h2>Lab Virtual Machine</h2>

  <p>You are required to do all labs on the class virtual machine (based on Ubuntu Linux).
    To get the virtual machine running on your personal desktop or laptop, take the following steps.
    <ul>
      <li>Step 1. Download the Virtualbox
        virtual machine monitor <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_3">Version 4.3.30</a>
        (Please just use version 4.3.30 and <b>not</b> any other version.) Choose the right
        binary to download according to the type of operating system running on your laptop.
      <li>Step 2. Download the class virtual machine image <a href="http://tintin.news.cs.nyu.edu/lubuntu14.04.ova">here.</a>
        This file is fairly large (1.1GB), so you need to be patient.
      <li>Step 3. Install and launch Virtualbox. On the Virtualbox application toolbar, under the Menu
        item "File", click on "Import appliance...", and choose the previously downloaded lubuntu14.04.ova file
        when prompted.
      <li>Step 4. After importing, start the virtual machine named "lubuntu" and log in using
        the username and password given in Piazza).
        Change your password.
    </ul>


    <p>If you wish to use your own existing Linux-based desktop or laptop instead
      of the class virtual machine, the labs might just work, but note that we don't
      have the energy or expertise to debug any problems you might have.

      <h2>Lab Repository Setup</h2>
      For each student in the class, we have created him/her a corresponding private
      lab repository on Github.com. You will submit labs by pushing to your private
      repo on github.com (as many times as you want) and we will collect labs for
      grading after the lab deadline directly from Github.com. Below are the steps
      for setting up your the lab environment on your laptop. If you are not
      familiar with the <tt>git</tt> version control system, follow the resources <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/">here</a>
      to get started.

      <h3>Cloning your lab repo locally</h3>
      <p>In a VirtualBox terminal, clone your repo by typing the following:
        <pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/nyu-ds/&lt;YourGithubUsername&gt;-golabs-2016.git golabs
$ cd &lt;YourGithubUsername&gt;-golabs-2016
</pre>

        You will see that a directory named <tt>&lt;YourGithubUsername&gt;-golabs-2016</tt> has been created under your
        home directory. This is the git repo for your lab assignments throughout the semester.

        <h3>Setting up the upstream repo</h3>
        The lab skeleton code are kept in the repo <a href="https://github.com/nyu-ds/golabs-2016"><tt>golabs-2016</tt></a>
        managed by the course staff. Therefore, the first thing you need to do is to
        set up your own lab repo to track the changes made in the <tt>golabs-2016</tt> repo.
        In the git world, <tt>golabs-2016</tt> would be your "upstream" repo from which changes
        should ``flow'' into your own lab repo.

        <p>Type <tt>git remote add</tt> to add the upstream repo, and <tt>git remote -v</tt> to check that <tt>golabs-2016</tt>
          is indeed an upstream for your own lab repo.
          <pre>
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/nyu-ds/golabs-2016.git
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:nyu-ds/golabs-2016.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:nyu-ds/golabs-2016.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/nyu-ds/golabs-2016.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/nyu-ds/golabs-2016.git (push)
</pre>

          <p>Immediately, you should check if the upstream golabs-2016 repo has additional changes not present in your
            repo. You can check for and merge in those changes by typing:
            <pre>
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
</pre>
            You should perform the above two steps periodically to ensure that you've got the latest lab code.
            We will also remind you to fetch upstream on Piazza if we make changes/bug-fixes to the labs.

            <h3>Saving changes while you are working on Labs</h3>
            As you modify the skeleton files to complete the labs, you should frequently save your
            work to protect against laptop failures and other unforeseen troubles.
            You save the changes by first "committing" them to your local lab repo and then "pushing"
            those changes to the repo stored on github.com
            <pre>
$ git commit -am "saving my changes"
$ git push origin
</pre>

            Note that whenever you add a new file, you need to manually tell git to ``track it''.
            Otherwise, the file will not be committed by <tt>git commit</tt>. Make git track a new file by typing:
            <pre>
$ git add &lt;my-new-file&gt;
</pre>
            After you've pushed your changes with <tt>git push</tt>, they are safely stored on github.com.
            Even if your laptop catches on fire in the future, those pushed changes can still be retrieved.
            However, you must remember that <tt>git commit</tt> by itself does not save your changes on github.com
            (it only saves your changes locally). So, don't forget to type that <tt>git push origin</tt>.

            <p>
              To see if your local repo is up-to-date with your origin repo on github.com and vice versa, type
              <pre>
$ git status
</pre>

              <h3>Handin Procedure</h3>

              To handin your files, simply commit and push them to github.com
              <pre>
$ git commit -am "saving all my changes and handing in"
$ git push origin 
</pre>

              We will fetching your lab files from Github.com at the specified deadline and grade them.
